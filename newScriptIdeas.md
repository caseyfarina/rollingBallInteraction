I would like to create a few new scripts that will fit into this system. 

* A script that will play a sound file using the "playoneshot" method. When the public function entitled "playSound" is called the script chooses randomly from the array of audio clips loaded into the script in the editor. The script should also have volume parameter that defaults to .5 . this script is designed to be triggered from the collision, trigger, or button event scripts. This script should create an audio source component when the game is started.
* A script that displays text on the screen using the TextMeshPro object. This script should have a following controls in the editor : font and time on screen. Every time the "displayText" function is called on this script it displays the text for the prescribed amount of time. There will be an instance of this script on a TM pro object on the canvas. Students will access the "text display" object from other unity events when they want text displayed on screen. The display text public dynamic function should have a text string argument that can be configured within the Unity event system in the editor.
